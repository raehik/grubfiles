grubfiles
=========

GRUB config files.

Things like my auto-booting if shift isn't down, more comments on things,
reboot/shutdown options in the menu, and even a script to produce nice
background images (that's `convert-to-background-image`)!

To install, run `install`. Files are copied to where you'd expect.
